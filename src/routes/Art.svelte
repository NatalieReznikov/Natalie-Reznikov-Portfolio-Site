However, their abundance and propensity to adversely precipitate as mineral requires a generalized inhibition. Selective removal of such inhibition (“inhibiting the inhibitor”) to allow mineralization can be used to define the size, shape and layout of an organism (from in utero through to adulthood). As part of this process there is the third tier of mineralization regulation – the fine interfacial enzyme-stenciling control that provides refinement for mechanical resilience, metabolic responsiveness, morphological precision and sensitivity to loading, to name a few, that apparently can distinguish life from death, and health from disease.</div>",
